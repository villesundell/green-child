This is a child theme for the [Twenty Twenty-Five](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentyfive/) theme shipped with [WordPress](https://wordpress.org). Once your site looks good with Twenty Twenty-Five, you can install this child theme to bring the Finnish [Green League's](https://vihreat.fi) brand on it. You can acquire the *Krana Fat A* font from the party's office, and place it to `fonts/` as `krana-fat-a.otf`. The theme works without the font too, falling back to *Barlow Semi
Condensed* as defined in the brand guideline.
